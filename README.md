# Production-Grade Microservices Patterns with Spring Boot 4

Event-driven, production-focused microservices architecture using Java 25 and Spring Boot 4. Focus areas: failure
handling, idempotency, retry, dead-letter topics (DLT) and safe recovery. This repository validates proven
distributed-system patterns on the latest JVM and Spring ecosystem.

## Key Architecture Principles

- Gateway-first design
- Event-driven communication (Kafka)
- Saga choreography (no orchestration)
- No synchronous service-to-service calls
- Idempotency at every layer
- Kafka-native retry & DLT
- Manual, audited DLT replay
- Recovery-first mindset

---

## Services Overview

### 1. API Gateway (Reactive)

**Technology**

- Spring Cloud Gateway
- Spring WebFlux
- Spring Security

**Responsibilities**

- Single entry point
- JWT validation via JWKS
- Rate limiting, role-based routing, request logging

**Notes**

- Reactive by design (high concurrency)
- No DB access, no Kafka interaction

### 2. Auth Service (JWT RS256 + JWKS)

**Responsibilities**

- Issue JWT tokens
- Maintain private signing keys
- Expose public keys via JWKS

**Why RS256**

- No shared secrets, independent token validation, safe key rotation

### 3. Order Service (Saga Initiator)

**Responsibilities**

- Order lifecycle ownership
- HTTP idempotency (Idempotency-Key)
- Outbox pattern, saga timeout compensation

**Patterns**

- Outbox (DB + event atomicity), Kafka publishing, typed domain events

### 4. Payment Service (Critical Path)

**Responsibilities**

- Process payments, maintain immutable ledger
- Emit payment events, handle retries and DLT

**Key Guarantees**

- Append-only ledger, multi-layer idempotency, separation of business vs technical failures

### 5. Notification Service (Side-Effect Isolation)

**Responsibilities**

- Consume payment events, send notifications, track delivery attempts

**Design Goal**

- Failures here must never block business flow

### 6. DLT Replay Admin Service

**Responsibilities**

- ADMIN-only access
- Replay by topic/partition/offset
- Re-publish to original topic without payload mutation
- Full audit trail

**Important**

- Replay is a human decision, not automatic

---

## Event-Driven Saga Choreography

- Choreography (no central coordinator)
- Services react to events and own decisions
- Failures are isolated and handled locally

---

## Kafka, Retry & DLT Strategy

**Kafka**

- Single integration backbone, at-least-once delivery, replayable history

**Retry**

- Spring Kafka DefaultErrorHandler
- Offset-aware, non-blocking, backoff-based

**Dead Letter Topics (DLT)**

- Used only for technical failures
- Payload preserved, failure metadata in headers
- Safe for audited replay

---

## Security Model

- JWT RS256 everywhere, JWKS validation in all services
- Role-based access control
- ADMIN-only operational endpoints
- Each service acts as a resource server
- No shared secrets

---

## Idempotency Strategy

Idempotency enforced at multiple layers:

- HTTP: Idempotency-Key
- Kafka: consumer-side deduplication logic
- Database: unique constraints
- Ledger: immutable writes

Prevents duplicate orders, double payments, corrupted saga state.

## Important Note on Java 25 & Spring Boot 4

This project targets Java 25 and Spring Boot 4 to validate architectural correctness and failure-handling semantics (
Kafka, DLT, retry, saga) without coupling to experimental APIs. The goal is correctness and reliability over showcasing
bleeding-edge framework features.

---

## What This Project Proves

- Framework upgrades do not require architecture rewrites
- Reliability comes from design, not annotations
- DLT and replay tooling are first-class citizens
- Observability beats ad-hoc logging
- Failure handling must be explicit and testable

---

## How to Run (High Level)

1. Start infrastructure: Kafka, MySQL, Redis
2. Run services in order:
    1. Auth Service
    2. API Gateway
    3. Order Service
    4. Payment Service
    5. Notification Service
    6. DLT Replay Admin
3. Each service is independently deployable.

README and the operational admin docs in this repository.
